## What is Plant-it?
Plant-it is a gardening companion app that helps you take care of your plants.

It does not recommend you about which action to take, instead it is designed to logs the activity you are doing. This is on purpose, I strongly believe that the only one in charge of know when to water your plants, when to fertilize them, etc. is you (with the help of multiple online sources).

Plant-it helps you remember the last time you did a treatment of your plants, which plants you have, collects photos of your plants, and notify you about time passed since last action on them.

## Who is this for?
Plant-It is designed for gardening enthusiasts, plant lovers, and anyone seeking a comprehensive and user-friendly platform to enhance their gardening experience. Whether you are a beginner looking to start your first garden or an experienced gardener wanting to streamline plant care and tracking, Plant-It offers a self-hosted gardening companion app to meet your needs. This application is tailored for individuals passionate about keeping their plants healthy, receiving timely care reminders, documenting plant growth, and enjoying a seamless gardening experience.
