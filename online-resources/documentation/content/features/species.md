To modify an existing species, tap the search icon in the bottom bar, enter the species name, and select it. Next, click the edit button in the top right of the window, make the necessary updates, and then click "Save." The species will be updated. If it originated from the Trefle service, a new custom species will be generated, and all plants linked to the Trefle species will be associated with the new one. If it was already a custom species, it will be straightforwardly updated.
