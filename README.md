## Why?
Plant-it is a gardening companion app that helps you take care of your plants.

It does not recommend you about which action to take, instead it is designed to logs the activity you are doing.
This is on purpose, I strongly believe that the only one in charge of know when to water your plants, when to fertilize them, etc. is you (with the help of multiple online sources).

Plant-it helps you remember the last time you did a treatment of your plants, which plants you have, collects photos of your plants, and notify you about time passed since last action on them.


## Features highlight
* Add existing plants using [Trefle API](https://trefle.io/) or user created plants to your collection
* Log events like watering, fertilizing, biostimulating, etc. for your plants
* View all the logged events, filtering by plant and event type
* Upload photos of your plants
* ðŸ”œ Share plants with other users
* ðŸ”œ Set reminder for some actions on your plants (e.g. notify if not watered every 4 days)
* ðŸ”œ Dark/Light mode

## Getting started
Installing Plant-it is pretty straight forward, in order to do so follow these steps:

1. Create a folder where you want to place all Plant-it related files.
1. Inside that folder, create the following files:
    * `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    version: "3"
    name: plant-it
    services:
        backend:
            image: msdeluise/plant-it-backend:latest
            env_file: backend.env
            depends_on:
            - db
            - cache
            restart: unless-stopped
            volumes:
            - "./upload-dir:/upload-dir"
            ports:
            - "8080:8080"

        db:
            image: mysql:8.0
            restart: always
            env_file: backend.env
            volumes:
            - "./db:/var/lib/mysql"

        cache:
            image: redis:7.2.1
            restart: always

        frontend:
            image: msdeluise/plant-it-frontend:latest
            env_file: frontend.env
            links:
            - backend
            ports:
            - "3000:3000"
    ```
    * `backend.env`:
    ```properties
    MYSQL_HOST=db
    MYSQL_PORT=3306
    MYSQL_USERNAME=root
    MYSQL_PSW=root
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
    MYSQL_DATABASE=bootdb
    JWT_SECRET=putTheSecretHere
    JWT_EXP=1
    USERS_LIMIT=-1
    UPLOAD_DIR=/upload-dir
    API_PORT=8080
    CACHE_TTL=86400
    CACHE_HOST=cache
    CACHE_PORT=6379
    TREFLE_KEY=
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
    LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
    ```
    * `frontend.env`:
    ```properties
    PORT=3000
    API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
    WAIT_TIMEOUT=10000
    PAGE_SIZE=25
    BROWSER=none
    ```
1. Run the docker compose file (`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`), then the service will be available at `localhost:3000`, while the REST API will be available at `localhost:8080/api` (`localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html` for the documentation of them).

<a href="https://docs.plant-it.org/installation/configurations/">Take a look at the documentation</a> in order to understand the available configurations and let the service be available even from another machine.
