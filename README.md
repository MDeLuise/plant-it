## Why?
Plant-it is a gardening companion app that helps you take care of your plants.

It does not recommend you about which action to take; instead, it is designed to log the activity you are doing. This is on purpose, as I strongly believe that the only one in charge of knowing when to water your plants, when to fertilize them, etc., is you (with the help of multiple online sources).

Plant-it helps you remember the last time you did a treatment of your plants, which plants you have, collects photos of your plants, and notifies you about the time passed since the last action on them.

## Features highlight
* Add existing plants or user-created plants to your collection
* Log events like watering, fertilizing, biostimulating, etc. for your plants
* View all the logged events, filtering by plant and event type
* Upload photos of your plants
* Set reminders for some actions on your plants (e.g., notify if not watered every 4 days)

    </p>

> **Note on iOS and Play Store Availability:**  
> Currently, there is no iOS version of the app, nor is it available on the Play Store. This decision is based on my preference not to pay for publishing a free app, as well as concerns about privacy. I aim to minimize sharing personal data, such as my address, with large corporations like Google or Apple. Therefore, the app is currently exclusively available for Android users through the alternative sources mentioned above.
